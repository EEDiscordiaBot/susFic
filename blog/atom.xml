I rubbed my eyes and walked straight into the glowing light unsure of where it lead to or even why I walked towards it. Stepping through that portal I became a pony not just any random pony, a bright blue technicolor pony standing in the middle of a busy street, I looked at myself looked behind, underneeth and behind again. Damn I've got wings now.</p><p>When I finally stop glazing and trying to flap my wings I was amazed by my suroundings. So many beautiful farm houses with other ponies walking around it was like an explosin of all pony sensnes. Then I realised, oh buck. I'm small  I'm a foal. A young young young foal. I stood up and galoped on the cobblestone streets to the outskirts of the city. I needed someplace to think as well as rest to figure out what the hay this world is and what am I doing here.</p><p>I rode off into the distance, the scenery started changing from houses to farms and finally to large open planes with flowing hills. I found a patch of grass under a beautiful tree and sat down. Moments later a squad of what looks like 4 peagsus ponies in golden armor entered the horizon, I paniked and fled running as fast as I can but they chassed after me.</p>]]></content>
