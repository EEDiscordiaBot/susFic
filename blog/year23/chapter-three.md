The white-colored one opened her mouth but no words came out; it was like she was speaking in my head. "Hello Snek, welcome to Equestria. On my left sits Princess Luna, and on her left sits Derpy, Princess of Greece.‚Äù

Mouth agape and slowly realizing I was sort of staring at Twilight. I immediately snap back and look at Celestia and noticed that Twilight was slightly blushing in the corner of my eyes. 

Celestia continued, "It seems like you have been sent here by some unknown force that is outside of our control, but it seems like you will be here permanently for the rest of your life. Do you have any knowledge of your past?"

I pondered and tried to think past the glowing orb, but nothing came up in my head. I solemnly shook my head and looked at the floor. 

She stood up and trotted (?) over to me and lay a hoof on my shoulder; it felt almost motherly. I slowly felt my muscles relax, my worry left me, and I felt my brain unravel. 

"Your memories seem to be gone, but your basic knowledge of words, numbers, and algebra seem intact. That's a good start; we will help you join the society by giving you classes and courses provided by us to help you get used to our world and culture. These courses will also allow you to get a job and a house. Princess Derpy and Twilight will check on you every few days. Do you need anything else?" said Celestia.

My head slowly rises full of gratitude. "Thank you, Princess. I am extremely grateful for this chance to fit into Equestria, and thank you for the courses. I will forever remember this moment."

The grey one called Derpy rises and tells the guards to lead me back to my room? Wait, my room? I have a room in the castle? The royal castle? Damn, my mind trails off as I follow the guards back to my room in the castle. 

A guard opened the door and said that I may stay in the room or walk around the castle as well as the city nearby as long as I don't get into trouble or enter any restricted areas. I bowed and thanked her; the guards shuffled out of the room and closed the doors behind them.

I finally have time to inspect the room and observe my surroundings without a pounding head or a beautiful mare in front of me. I slowly walked around the room, taking in every intimate detail from the beautifully stitched rugs to the tapestry on the walls. I walked past what looks like a door; time to figure out how to use these hoofs. I slightly push open the door, and it opens up to a large bathroom. 
Complete with a sink, bathtub, and standing shower area. Talk about perfection. The gold-plated mirrors, tiny faucets are all a sight to behold. My slow horse brain starts to take in the rest of it. I do a quick 360 and notice a door next to my door is opened; I step in to find a large floor-to-ceiling walk-in closet with all sorts of outfits. I take off this boring white thing I walked into this world with and started trying on various suits and shirts. Looking at the tag, they all said, "Custom made by Rarity." These are certainly really high-quality clothing. After trying on several clothes, I'd hung them and the white cloth in the cabinet and grabbed a bathrobe and hung it up next to the shower and hopped in. 

There were a stack of storm-blue and sunny-yellow colored clouds which I could only assume are for cold and warm water. I tried to pick one up with my hooves but obviously failed. I grunted in frustration, tried again but obviously no luck. Then I turned around to look at the stack, hoping for some instruction manual I failed to read, but next to the door Twilight, the princess herself, was standing there mouth semi-agape and me in the shower.

Oh, shit, I hurry to cover myself with my wings, and she yelps and turns around. "Hurry up and put on something," I quickly obliged, putting on the bathrobe. She turned around again, looking me up and down; I could feel my cheeks burn.

"Sorry about that," I said.

"Not your fault; it's mine for not knocking," she replied while blushing as red as an apple, looking slightly downwards looking at my slightly erect stallionhood. 

My brain went into full panic mode, unsure how to act, and I haven't even realized it's grown that big. I slightly cross my hooves so it blocks the view. She looked back up at me slightly disappointed while biting her lower lip, and
