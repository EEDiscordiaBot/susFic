The white coloured one opened her mouth but no words game out it was like she was speaking in my head "Hello Snek, welcome to Equestria on my left sites Princess Luna and on her left sits Derpy Princess of Greece‚Äù.

Mouth agape and slowly realising I was sorta staring at twilight. I immedtately snap back and look at the Celestia and noticed that Twilight was slightly blushing in the conner of my eyes. 

Celestia continuted, "It seems like you have been sent here by some unkown force4 that is outside of our control but it seems like you will be here permantly for the rest of your life. Do you have any knowlage of your past?"

I pondered and tried to think past the glowing orb but nothing came up in my head. I solemly shook my head and looked at the floor. 

She stood up and thorted (?) over to me and lay a hoof on my sholder, it felt almost motherly I slowly felt my muscles relax my worry left me and I felt my brain onravell. 

"Your memorises seem to be gone but your basic knowlage of words, numbers and alegra seem intact. That's a good start we will help you join the soceity by giving you classes and courses provided by us to help you get used to our world and culture. These courses will also allow you to get a job and a house. Princess Derpy and Twilight will check on you every few days. Do you need anything else?" said Celestia.

My head slowly rises full of gratitude. "Thank you princess, I am extremely grateful for this chance to fit into Equastria and thank you for the courses. I will forver rerember this moment"

The grey one called Derpy rises and tells the guards to lead me back to my room? Wait my room? I  have a room in the castle? The royal castle? Damn my mind trails off as I follow the guards back to my room in the castle. 

A guard opened the door and said that I may stay in the room or walk around the castle as well as the city nearby as long as I don't get into trouble or enter any restricted areas. I bowed and thanked her the guards shuffled out the room and closed the doors behind them.

I finally have time to inspect the room and observe my surroundings without a pounding head or a beautiful mare infront of me. I slowly walked around the room taking in every intimate detail from the beautiful stiched rugs to the tapastry on the walls. I walked pass what looks like a door, time to figure out how to use these hoofs. I slightly push open the door and It opens up to a large bathroom. 
Complete with a sink, bathtub and standing shower area. Talk about perfection. The gold plated mirrors, tiny facults is all a sight to behold. My slow horse brain starts to take in the rest of it. I do a quick 360 and notice a door next to my door id opened it and stepped in to a large floor to ceeling walk in closet with all sorts of outfits. I take off this boring white thing I walked into this world with and started trying on various suits and shirts. Looking at the tag they all said "Custom made by Rarity". These are certainly really high quality clothing. After trying on serval clothes Id hung them and the white clothe in the cabinate and grabbed a bath robe and hung it up next to the shower and hopped in. 

There where a stack of storm-blue and sunny-yellow coloured clouds which I could only asume are for cold and warm water. I tried to pick one up with my hooves but obviously failled. I grunted in fustration tried again but obviously no luck. Then I turned around to look at the stack hoping for some instruction manual. Just as I looked under a stack of paper there was a guide titled "A guide for clouds for newbies". 

I let out a soft "Yay!" of happines knowing I would not have to suffer and figure out how to use these wings and powers. I grabbed the book and put on that gown and hopped on the bed and spent nearly an hour or two reading the whole book and trying out my wings and flying. Since the room was about a couple of stallions high I could fly around freely without any worries. Damn it felt amazing being able to hover, fly and do loop de loops. However, I started to get sweaty as in really sweaty so I hopped into the shower and hovered the clowd above me and just let the water wash off all the pony sweat. 

Stepping out of the shower I dried myself off and got into a nice shirt. Walking out into the main room I decided to fly around the castle to do a little flying practice. I fly pass so many hallways and doors and ended up in the cortyard. What hit me first was the smell of flowers in bloom and various herbs such as basil ü™¥ growing in the garden. After my little pony brain finished processing all the smells I lookaround taking in the tall beautiful hedges and hedge scultures. 

As the sunw as setting I decided to go back inside decidiing to take another route back to my room and passed by a grand libary, it was open so I decided to walk in and was suddenly emerced in a multistory libary with millions. No, billions of books. I decided to run up to a bookshelf and grab a book and pulled it off the shelf and read the title. It stated "The Lore Of Equastria and its goverments." I hopped to a nearby couch and started reading page by page. Seconds turned into hours as time flew I read all about the past years, wars and technology from year minus 300 to Year 23. Suddenly, I heard Twilight's voice from somewhere above.

"I see you like books too? You really should be sleeping now you seem a little EEpy," she inquired.

I looked up towards and simply replied with, "Gotta love books they always seem to have something interesting story to tell and thanks for asking, i'm actually not that tired to be honest."
