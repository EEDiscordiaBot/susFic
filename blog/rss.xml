No full on clop though</p></div></div><p>The white coloured one opened her mouth but no words game out it was like she was speaking in my head "Hello Snek, welcome to Equestria on my left sites Princess Luna and on her left sits Derpy Princess of Greece‚Äù.</p><p>Mouth agape and slowly realising I was sorta staring at twilight. I immedtately snap back and look at the Celestia and noticed that Twilight was slightly blushing in the conner of my eyes. </p><p>Celestia continuted, "It seems like you have been sent here by some unkown force4 that is outside of our control but it seems like you will be here permantly for the rest of your life. Do you have any knowlage of your past?"</p><p>I pondered and tried to think past the glowing orb but nothing came up in my head. I solemly shook my head and looked at the floor. </p><p>She stood up and thorted (?) over to me and lay a hoof on my sholder, it felt almost motherly I slowly felt my muscles relax my worry left me and I felt my brain onravell. </p><p>"Your memorises seem to be gone but your basic knowlage of words, numbers and alegra seem intact. That's a good start we will help you join the soceity by giving you classes and courses provided by us to help you get used to our world and culture. These courses will also allow you to get a job and a house. Princess Derpy and Twilight will check on you every few days. Do you need anything else?" said Celestia.</p><p>My head slowly rises full of gratitude. "Thank you princess, I am extremely grateful for this chance to fit into Equastria and thank you for the courses. I will forver rerember this moment"</p><p>The grey one called Derpy rises and tells the guards to lead me back to my room? Wait my room? I  have a room in the castle? The royal castle? Damn my mind trails off as I follow the guards back to my room in the castle. </p><p>A guard opened the door and said that I may stay in the room or walk around the castle as well as the city nearby as long as I don't get into trouble or enter any restricted areas. I bowed and thanked her the guards shuffled out the room and closed the doors behind them.</p><p>I finally have time to inspect the room and observe my surroundings without a pounding head or a beautiful mare infront of me. I slowly walked around the room taking in every intimate detail from the beautiful stiched rugs to the tapastry on the walls. I walked pass what looks like a door, time to figure out how to use these hoofs. I slightly push open the door and It opens up to a large bathroom.
Complete with a sink, bathtub and standing shower area. Talk about perfection. The gold plated mirrors, tiny facults is all a sight to behold. My slow horse brain starts to take in the rest of it. I do a quick 360 and notice a door next to my door id opened it and stepped in to a large floor to ceeling walk in closet with all sorts of outfits. I take off this boring white thing I walked into this world with and started trying on various suits and shirts. Looking at the tag they all said "Custom made by Rarity". These are certainly really high quality clothing. After trying on serval clothes Id hung them and the white clothe in the cabinate and grabbed a bath robe and hung it up next to the shower and hopped in. </p><p>There where a stack of storm-blue and sunny-yellow coloured clouds which I could only asume are for cold and warm water. I tried to pick one up with my hooves but obviously failled. I grunted in fustration tried again but obviously no luck. Then I turned around to look at the stack hoping for some instruction manual i failed to read but next to the door Twilight the princess herself was standing there mouth semi-agape and me in the shower.</p><p>Oh shit, I hurry to cover myself with my wings and she yelps and turns around. "Hurry up and put on something", I quickly oblided putting on the bathrobe. She turned around again looking me up and down I could feel my cheeks burn.</p><p>"Sorry bout that," I said</p><p>"Not your fault, its mine for not knocking," she replied whilst blushing as red as an apple looking slightly donwards looking at my slightly erect stallionhood. </p><p>My brain went into full panic mode unsure how to act and I havent even realised its growned that big. I slightly cross my hooves so its blocks the view. She looked upback at me slightly dissapointed whilst biting her lower lip and finally after a solid 5 seconds she spoke, "Came over to tell you how water works here, since your a peagsus pony you can control clouds to use as well rainclouds. The dark-storm clouds represent cold water and the sunshine-yellow represent warm water. Its usually second nature to pegasi but you kinda just calm down, feel the water inside and sync in with the moisture and take a deep breath and just release it," </p><p>Twilight hovered a cloud above me with her magic and I tried once, twice and even thrice but no luck. Twilight rests a hoof on my sholder and I tried then it was like the sky opening up above then me and Twilight where drenched in soaking cold water. </p><p>Shit. She yelped and slipped and landed ontop of me. Such an awkward position my stallion hoodtwitching.
I start to ramble and try to aplogise but she put one hoof on my chest and rubbed herself on me. Just as I was getting comfortable flash appeared in the doorway. </p><p>I locked eyes with him and he swiftly pulled Twilight off my hips. He yelled at her "How do you let some peasnt that isnt even from here take control of you." Before she could reply he tackles me to the ground bracking the marble and class showerwalls the world shattered around me but most importantly my stallionhood hurt alot due to the impact of having a full grown male stallion tackling me into marble.</p><p>Like a thousand gunshot wounds my whole stallionhood shot up with pain and I curled up into a feetle position and Twilight screamed "Thats not friendship, PENELOPEEEE GET A MEDIC AND THE GUARDS"</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://derpicdn.net/img/view/2013/9/26/435695.png" alt="Twi Friendship" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Image belongs to their original authors. Source: <a href="https://derpibooru.org/images/435695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://derpibooru.org/images/435695</a></p><p>The world swims around me with neddles of pain everywhere. Twilight tackles flash and starts screaming her head off whilst trying to keep her down. Penelope  runs into the room to help twilight hold him down. I feel blood drip from my wings as white shirted ponies which I can only assume are the medics run over to me. They try to stop the bleeding but I pass out.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>This chater is to be countied but I am waiting for a poll to finish then we decide what to do with flash</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Legs screaming, breath panting, hooves screaming. I overhear screams and shouts of various military orders and vaguely catch a name. Merloy? No, Penelope. That's right, Penelope, a unicorn with a beautiful white coat with grey streaks like a zebra led the chase in a tight V formation. Legs tiring, I jumped up into the air, putting a lot of trust into my wings to fly up. </p><p>"YES, I'M FLYING!" I screamed out for the world to see.</p><p>Dammit, seconds later I was tackled into the ground with Penelope holding me down, with the guards rushing over to cuff me. The hay, I have done nothing wrong. The orange one knocked me in the head, and all went dark.</p><p><strong> Hours Later: </strong></p><p>I wake up cold, tired, and hungry but comfortable. My senses start to return; hoof on my pounding head, I look around and get used to my surroundings. A closed double door with gold knobs, fancy glass-painted windows, and a 4-poster bed. I look to my left and jump up; a purple pony with a darn beautiful mane stares at me. My eyes refocused, and I realized she has a unicorn horn and wings. My mouth agape; she tilts her head, looks at me, and starts to speak, her voice like a thousand angels.</p><p>"Hello! I am Twilight Sparkle; welcome to Equestria!" Said the purple unicorn-Pegasus pony.
"Ummm, Hi, I'm Snek," I calmly replied.
"Sorry about your head; Flash wasn‚Äôt meant to hit you that hard. Just enough so you would stop running away," Twilight calmly said.</p><p>Twilight's horn started to glow, and my headache started to fade.</p><p>"Better?" the unicorn-Pegasus inquired.</p><p>"Indeed, thank you," I bowed while sitting down. Awkward, eh?</p><p>The noise of knocking doors jerks us out of the awkward silence. The doors creaked opened, two ponies on each side with Flash in the middle; he glared intensely at me. What I could only assume is jealousy. </p><p>His deep booming voice ricocheted across the room, "Guards cuff him.‚Äù</p><p>The guards rushed up towards the bed with some magical handcuff thingies in hand, but Twilight stands between them, "That will not be necessary; Snek won't cause any harm to the palace or me." I awkwardly nod. The orange idiot opens his mouth, "But love-". Twilight holds a hoof out to him and interrupts him mid-sentence "it will be fine."</p><p>The orange balloon huffed and glared at me before instructing the guards to escort me up to the throne room, leaving Twilight behind. I was escorted upwards through the twisting halls with beautiful red carpets past portraits of what I could only assume are the princesses. I enter this grand room which has giant glass windows that overlooked the buildings below. Four Thrones sat in the room with four guards on each side. A second later all four thrones were filled. Twilight on the left, followed by some white, green-haired one on her right, a dark blue princess with a nice flowing mane and a little grey Pegasus on the right with a muffin.</p><p>The white-colored one opened her mouth, but no words came out; it was like she was speaking in my head. "Hello Snek, welcome to Equestria. I'm Celestia; on my left sits Princess Luna and on her left sits Derpy, Princess of Greece.‚Äù</p>]]></content:encoded>

I rubbed my eyes and walked straight into the glowing light, unsure of where it led to or even why I walked toward it. Stepping through that portal, I became a pony, not just any random pony, a bright blue technicolor pony standing in the middle of a busy street. I looked at myself, looked behind, underneath, and behind again. Damn, I've got wings now.</p><p>When I finally stopped gazing and trying to flap my wings, I was amazed by my surroundings. So many beautiful farmhouses with other ponies walking around; it was like an explosion of all pony senses. Then I realized, oh buck. I'm small, I'm a foal. A young, young, young foal. I stood up and galloped on the cobblestone streets to the outskirts of the city. I needed someplace to think as well as rest to figure out what the hay this world is and what am I doing here.</p><p>I rode off into the distance; the scenery started changing from houses to farms and finally to large open plains with flowing hills. I found a patch of grass under a beautiful tree and sat down. Moments later, a squad of what looks like 4 pegasus ponies in golden armor entered the horizon. I panicked and fled, running as fast as I can, but they chased after me.</p>]]></content:encoded>
