On my left sits Princess Luna, and on her left sits Derpy, Princess of Greece.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMouth agape and slowly realizing I was sort of staring at Twilight. I immediately snap back and look at Celestia and noticed that Twilight was slightly blushing in the corner of my eyes. \\r\\n\\r\\nCelestia continued, \\"It seems like you have been sent here by some unknown force that is outside of our control, but it seems like you will be here permanently for the rest of your life. Do you have any knowledge of your past?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI pondered and tried to think past the glowing orb, but nothing came up in my head. I solemnly shook my head and looked at the floor. \\r\\n\\r\\nShe stood up and trotted (?) over to me and lay a hoof on my shoulder; it felt almost motherly. I slowly felt my muscles relax, my worry left me, and I felt my brain unravel. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Your memories seem to be gone, but your basic knowledge of words, numbers, and algebra seem intact. That\'s a good start; we will help you join the society by giving you classes and courses provided by us to help you get used to our world and culture. These courses will also allow you to get a job and a house. Princess Derpy and Twilight will check on you every few days. Do you need anything else?\\" said Celestia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy head slowly rises full of gratitude. \\"Thank you, Princess. I am extremely grateful for this chance to fit into Equestria, and thank you for the courses. I will forever remember this moment.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grey one called Derpy rises and tells the guards to lead me back to my room? Wait, my room? I have a room in the castle? The royal castle? Damn, my mind trails off as I follow the guards back to my room in the castle. \\r\\n\\r\\nA guard opened the door and said that I may stay in the room or walk around the castle as well as the city nearby as long as I don\'t get into trouble or enter any restricted areas. I bowed and thanked her; the guards shuffled out of the room and closed the doors behind them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI finally have time to inspect the room and observe my surroundings without a pounding head or a beautiful mare in front of me. I slowly walked around the room, taking in every intimate detail from the beautifully stitched rugs to the tapestry on the walls. I walked past what looks like a door; time to figure out how to use these hoofs. I slightly push open the door, and it opens up to a large bathroom. \\r\\nComplete with a sink, bathtub, and standing shower area. Talk about perfection. The gold-plated mirrors, tiny faucets are all a sight to behold. My slow horse brain starts to take in the rest of it. I do a quick 360 and notice a door next to my door is opened; I step in to find a large floor-to-ceiling walk-in closet with all sorts of outfits. I take off this boring white thing I walked into this world with and started trying on various suits and shirts. Looking at the tag, they all said, \\"Custom made by Rarity.\\" These are certainly really high-quality clothing. After trying on several clothes, I\'d hung them and the white cloth in the cabinet and grabbed a bathrobe and hung it up next to the shower and hopped in. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a stack of storm-blue and sunny-yellow colored clouds which I could only assume are for cold and warm water. I tried to pick one up with my hooves but obviously failed. I grunted in frustration, tried again but obviously no luck. Then I turned around to look at the stack, hoping for some instruction manual I failed to read, but next to the door Twilight, the princess herself, was standing there mouth semi-agape and me in the shower.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, shit, I hurry to cover myself with my wings, and she yelps and turns around. \\"Hurry up and put on something,\\" I quickly obliged, putting on the bathrobe. She turned around again, looking me up and down; I could feel my cheeks burn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Sorry about that,\\" I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Not your fault; it\'s mine for not knocking,\\" she replied while blushing as red as an apple, looking slightly downwards looking at my slightly erect stallionhood. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy brain went into full panic mode, unsure how to act, and I haven\'t even realized it\'s grown that big. I slightly cross my hooves so it blocks the view. She looked back up at me slightly disappointed while biting her lower lip, and"},{"id":"chapter-two-castle","metadata":{"permalink":"/susFic/blog/chapter-two-castle","editUrl":"https://github.com/StoneMcYT/susFic/tree/main/blog/year23/chapter-two.md","source":"@site/blog/year23/chapter-two.md","title":"Year 23 Chapter Two: The Castle","description":"Date: 2nd January Year 23","date":"2023-08-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 6, 2023","tags":[{"label":"year23","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/year-23"},{"label":"Snek","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/snek"},{"label":"Twilight","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/twilight"},{"label":"Luna","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/luna"},{"label":"Derpy","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/derpy"},{"label":"Celestia","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/celestia"},{"label":"royal-guards","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/royal-guards"},{"label":"Penelope","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/penelope"},{"label":"SFW","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/sfw"},{"label":"POV","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/pov"},{"label":"Capitol","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/capitol"},{"label":"Castle","permalink":"/susFic/blog/tags/castle"}],"readingTime":2.855,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Snek","title":"Head Of The Problep Council","url":"https://github.com/StoneMcYT","image_url":"https://media.tenor.com/Y-nW5Z-k8W8AAAAC/starlight-glimmer-blep.gif","imageURL":"https://media.tenor.com/Y-nW5Z-k8W8AAAAC/starlight-glimmer-blep.gif"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"chapter-two-castle","title":"Year 23 Chapter Two: The Castle","authors":{"name":"Snek","title":"Head Of The Problep Council","url":"https://github.com/StoneMcYT","image_url":"https://media.tenor.com/Y-nW5Z-k8W8AAAAC/starlight-glimmer-blep.gif","imageURL":"https://media.tenor.com/Y-nW5Z-k8W8AAAAC/starlight-glimmer-blep.gif"},"tags":["year23","Snek","Twilight","Luna","Derpy","Celestia","royal-guards","Penelope","SFW","POV","Capitol","Castle"],"date":"2023-08-06T00:00:00.000Z"},"prevItem":{"title":"Year 23 Chapter Three: Meeting the Princess","permalink":"/susFic/blog/chapter-three-meeting-the-princess"},"nextItem":{"title":"Year 23 Chapter One: New Beginnings","permalink":"/susFic/blog/chapter-one-new-beginnings"}},"content":":::info\\r\\n\\r\\nDate: 2nd January Year 23\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDammit, I cursed to myself; my legs are screaming while the guards chased after me. Legs screaming, breath panting, hooves screaming. I overhear screams and shouts of various military orders and vaguely catch a name. Merloy? No, Penelope. That\'s right, Penelope, a unicorn with a beautiful white coat with grey streaks like a zebra led the chase in a tight V formation. Legs tiring, I jumped up into the air, putting a lot of trust into my wings to fly up. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"YES, I\'M FLYING!\\" I screamed out for the world to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nDammit, seconds later I was tackled into the ground with Penelope holding me down, with the guards rushing over to cuff me. The hay, I have done nothing wrong. The orange one knocked me in the head, and all went dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n** Hours Later: **\\r\\n\\r\\nI wake up cold, tired, and hungry but comfortable. My senses start to return; hoof on my pounding head, I look around and get used to my surroundings. A closed double door with gold knobs, fancy glass-painted windows, and a 4-poster bed. I look to my left and jump up; a purple pony with a darn beautiful mane stares at me. My eyes refocused, and I realized she has a unicorn horn and wings. My mouth agape; she tilts her head, looks at me, and starts to speak, her voice like a thousand angels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Hello! I am Twilight Sparkle; welcome to Equestria!\\" Said the purple unicorn-Pegasus pony.\\r\\n\\"Ummm, Hi, I\'m Snek,\\" I calmly replied.\\r\\n\\"Sorry about your head; Flash wasn\u2019t meant to hit you that hard. Just enough so you would stop running away,\\" Twilight calmly said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwilight\'s horn started to glow, and my headache started to fade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Better?\\" the unicorn-Pegasus inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Indeed, thank you,\\" I bowed while sitting down. Awkward, eh?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noise of knocking doors jerks us out of the awkward silence. The doors creaked opened, two ponies on each side with Flash in the middle; he glared intensely at me. What I could only assume is jealousy. \\r\\n\\r\\nHis deep booming voice ricocheted across the room, \\"Guards cuff him.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guards rushed up towards the bed with some magical handcuff thingies in hand, but Twilight stands between them, \\"That will not be necessary; Snek won\'t cause any harm to the palace or me.\\" I awkwardly nod. The orange idiot opens his mouth, \\"But love-\\". Twilight holds a hoof out to him and interrupts him mid-sentence \\"it will be fine.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orange balloon huffed and glared at me before instructing the guards to escort me up to the throne room, leaving Twilight behind. I was escorted upwards through the twisting halls with beautiful red carpets past portraits of what I could only assume are the princesses. I enter this grand room which has giant glass windows that overlooked the buildings below. Four Thrones sat in the room with four guards on each side. A second later all four thrones were filled. Twilight on the left, followed by some white, green-haired one on her right, a dark blue princess with a nice flowing mane and a little grey Pegasus on the right with a muffin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe white-colored one opened her mouth, but no words came out; it was like she was speaking in my head. \\"Hello Snek, welcome to Equestria.

I rubbed my eyes and walked straight into the glowing light, unsure of where it led to or even why I walked toward it. Stepping through that portal, I became a pony, not just any random pony, a bright blue technicolor pony standing in the middle of a busy street. I looked at myself, looked behind, underneath, and behind again. Damn, I\'ve got wings now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I finally stopped gazing and trying to flap my wings, I was amazed by my surroundings. So many beautiful farmhouses with other ponies walking around; it was like an explosion of all pony senses. Then I realized, oh buck. I\'m small, I\'m a foal. A young, young, young foal. I stood up and galloped on the cobblestone streets to the outskirts of the city. I needed someplace to think as well as rest to figure out what the hay this world is and what am I doing here.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rode off into the distance; the scenery started changing from houses to farms and finally to large open plains with flowing hills. I found a patch of grass under a beautiful tree and sat down. Moments later, a squad of what looks like 4 pegasus ponies in golden armor entered the horizon. I panicked and fled, running as fast as I can, but they chased after me."}]}')}}]);
