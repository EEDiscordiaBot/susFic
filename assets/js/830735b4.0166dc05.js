Legs screaming, breath panting, hooves screaming. I overhear screams and shouts of various military orders and vaguely catch a name. shorning? No, Shining. That\'s right, Shining, a unicorn with a beautiful white coat led the chase in a tight V formation. Legs tiring, I jumped up into the air, putting a lot of trust into my wings to fly up. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\"YES, I\'M FLYING!\\" I screamed out for the world to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nDammit, seconds later I was tackled into the ground with Shining holding me down, with the guards rushing over to cuff me. The hay, I have done nothing wrong. The orange one knocked me in the head, and all went dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n** Hours Later: **\\r\\n\\r\\nI wake up cold, tired, and hungry but comfortable. My senses start to return; hoof on my pounding head, I look around and get used to my surroundings. A closed double door with gold knobs, fancy glass-painted windows, and a 4-poster bed. I look to my left and jump up; a purple pony with a darn beautiful mane stares at me. My eyes refocused, and I realized she has a unicorn horn and wings. My mouth agape; she tilts her head, looks at me, and starts to speak, her voice like a thousand angels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Hello! I am Twilight Sparkle; welcome to Equestria!\\" Said the purple unicorn-Pegasus pony.\\r\\n\\"Ummm, Hi, I\'m Snek,\\" I calmly replied.\\r\\n\\"Sorry about your head; Flash wasn\u2019t meant to hit you that hard. Just enough so you would stop running away,\\" Twilight calmly said.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwilight\'s horn started to glow, and my headache started to fade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Better?\\" the unicorn-Pegasus inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Indeed, thank you,\\" I bowed while sitting down. Awkward, eh?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe noise of knocking doors jerks us out of the awkward silence. The doors creaked opened, two ponies on each side with Flash in the middle; he glared intensely at me. What I could only assume is jealousy. \\r\\n\\r\\nHis deep booming voice ricocheted across the room, \\"Guards cuff him.\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guards rushed up towards the bed with some magical handcuff thingies in hand, but Twilight stands between them, \\"That will not be necessary; Snek won\'t cause any harm to the palace or me.\\" I awkwardly nod. The orange idiot opens his mouth, \\"But love-\\". Twilight holds a hoof out to him and interrupts him mid-sentence \\"it will be fine.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe orange balloon huffed and glared at me before instructing the guards to escort me up to the throne room, leaving Twilight behind. I was escorted upwards through the twisting halls with beautiful red carpets past portraits of what I could only assume are the princesses. I enter this grand room which has giant glass windows that overlooked the buildings below. Four Thrones sat in the room with four guards on each side. A second later all four thrones were filled. Twilight on the left, followed by some white, green-haired one on her right, a dark blue princess with a nice flowing mane and a little grey Pegasus on the right with a muffin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe white-colored one opened her mouth, but no words came out; it was like she was speaking in my head. \\"Hello Snek, welcome to Equestria. I\'m Celestia; on my left sits Princess Luna and on her left sits Derpy, Princess of Greece.\u201d"},{"id":"chapter-one-new-beginnings","metadata":{"permalink":"/susFic/blog/chapter-one-new-beginnings","editUrl":"https://github.com/StoneMcYT/susFic/tree/main/blog/year23/chapter-one.md","source":"@site/blog/year23/chapter-one.md","title":"Year 23 Chapter One: New Beginnings","description":"This is an early chapter one draft so we can publish the webpage early and get everyone on the same system.

This chapter will NOT be extended in terms of content but grammar/spelling/style will be revamped.\\r\\n\\r\\nDate: 2nd January Year 23\\r\\n:::\\r\\nIt was one dark morning when I woke up in some unknown cave with a bright shining glowing orb in the center. I rubbed my eyes and walked straight into the glowing light, unsure of where it led to or even why I walked toward it. Stepping through that portal, I became a pony, not just any random pony, a bright blue technicolor pony standing in the middle of a busy street. I looked at myself, looked behind, underneath, and behind again. Damn, I\'ve got wings now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I finally stopped gazing and trying to flap my wings, I was amazed by my surroundings. So many beautiful farmhouses with other ponies walking around; it was like an explosion of all pony senses. Then I realized, oh buck. I\'m small, I\'m a foal. A young, young, young foal. I stood up and galloped on the cobblestone streets to the outskirts of the city. I needed someplace to think as well as rest to figure out what the hay this world is and what am I doing here.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rode off into the distance; the scenery started changing from houses to farms and finally to large open plains with flowing hills. I found a patch of grass under a beautiful tree and sat down. Moments later, a squad of what looks like 4 pegasus ponies in golden armor entered the horizon. I panicked and fled, running as fast as I can, but they chased after me."}]}')}}]);
