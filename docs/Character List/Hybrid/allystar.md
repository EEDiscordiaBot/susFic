**Special Trait:**

As the god of the oceans and water, his first power is to make it rain wherever he pleases, even in the most arid places. This comes in handy when he's using one of his other powers, which is that as soon as there's water or a similar liquid nearby, he can use it to make just about anything he wants, like an impenetrable barrier or a torrent. He also has control over natural disasters such as storms and hurricanes. He also possesses a power of regeneration, which allows him to generate very quickly from any injury, this power can also heal injuries that others might have, even more advanced stuff like being blind. He understands any language as if he were a native. His status also makes him partly immortal. 

**Notes:** 

Personality-wise, he has a tendency to flirt with anyone, often wanting to get into the pants of everyone he talks to. Naturally outgoing and energetic, he possesses a constant good humor, which can be a little nauseating at times.
