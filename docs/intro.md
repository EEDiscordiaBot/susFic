# How are fics grouped?â€‹

Fics are grouped by Year then Chapter. So for adding fic via the folder you will have to go via blog --> year --> chapter

# The Timeline

The timeline should be as follows:

For writing your chapters, they should usually be one-shots in the same universe. You should not skip around. E.g., don't have Pedrito born, then the parents have intercourse. Do not skip forward in the sense of the timeline. And try to write in a sequence of events.

## Location/Setting of the ENTIRE fic

The fic is set in an Equestria-styled Earth. So this means the geography, city names, states are the same as in real life. However, it is under one Equestrian government instead.

## Keeping Track Of Dates/Months

In this fic, all years have 12 months with each month being 30 days long. The reason for this is to prevent pain with leap years and awkward monthings.

Also, a note to those who use 'a moon' as measurement - this refers to 30 days (1 month).


## City State Naming:

USA has been been reneamed to Equastria with DC being canterlot

Canda has been renamed to the Crystal Kingdom


## Population Density
- Auastralia/New Zeland and that area are Changling Teritory
- The African continent is mainly populated by Zebra's
- Kirin's are mostly populated in forest areas (most dense in South America) but they are spread out


## Hierchy.

All countries and city states besides changling lands are have their figure monarch as Celestia/Luna. 

Each have their own goverments/leadership and the moanrchs just advise and handle any outer teritory threads eg extreme magic like Snek appearing out of no where
