# How Are Fics Grouped?

Fics are grouped by Year, then Chapter. To add a fic via the folder, you will need to navigate through the following path: blog ➔ year ➔ chapter.

# The Timeline

The timeline should adhere to the following guidelines:

- For writing your chapters, they should usually be one-shots within the same universe. Avoid skipping around. For example, don't have Pedrito born, then the parents have intercourse. Maintain continuity in the timeline and try to write in a sequence of events.

## Location/Setting of the ENTIRE Fic

The fic is set in an Equestria-styled Earth. This means that the geography, city names, and states are the same as in real life, but they are under one Equestrian government.

## Keeping Track Of Dates/Months

In this fic, all years consist of 12 months, with each month being 30 days long. This format is used to avoid complications with leap years and awkward month lengths.

Additionally, for those using 'a moon' as a measurement, it refers to 30 days (1 month).

## City State Naming:

- USA has been renamed to Equestria with DC being Canterlot.
- Canada has been renamed to the Crystal Kingdom.

## Population Density

- Australia/New Zealand and that area are Changeling Territory.
- The African continent is mainly populated by Zebras.
- Kirin's are mostly concentrated in forest areas, with the highest density in South America, but they are spread out.

## Hierarchy

All countries and city-states, besides Changeling lands, have their figure monarchs as Celestia/Luna. Each has its own government and leadership, with the monarchs serving in advisory roles and handling any external threats, such as extreme magical occurrences like Snek appearing out of nowhere.
